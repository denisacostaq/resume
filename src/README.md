Extra Experience
----------------

Personal projects
:   *[DAQs (Data Acquisition System)](https://github.com/denisacostaq/DAQs)* is
    a basic proff of concept project for avaluating the posibility to create
    portable (Desktop + Android) applications by using Qt technologies. From
    this project you can learn how to use some cool stuff like, travis CI
    pipelines, croscompiling C++/Qt projects to Android/ARM based mobiles,
    github badges, code coverage report, documentation generation using Doxygen
    and so on.

    *[Todo list](https://github.com/denisacostaq/todolist-go)* is a basic demo
    to demostrate how to use the golang
    [revel](https://revel.github.io/manual/index.html) framework for creating a
    RESTFull full-stack web application using AngularJS for the frontend and gorm
    as ORM library.

    *[clang-format-binary-releases](https://github.com/denisacostaq/clang-format-binary-releases)*
    is a ready to use binary executable for GNU/Linux and MacOS operatin systems
    of the [Clang Format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) project.

    *[stm3210fx3](https://github.com/denisacostaq/firmware-stm3210fx3)* an
    autotools based template to work with stm3210fx3 microcontrollers using the
    STM32F10x_StdPeriph and Free-RTOS libraries.

    C++/cocos2d-x based video game for mobile devices (Android).


Open Source
:   *[Embedded IDE](http://martinribelotta.github.io/embedded-ide)* is a 
    Makefile based integrated development environment primary think for bare
    processor development. This IDE, can be used for programming the
    [CIAA platform](http://www.proyecto-ciaa.com.ar/index_quees_en.html).

    *[Qt CLI installer](https://github.com/denisacostaq/qli-installer)* is a
    simple script replacing the official online-only graphical Qt installer.
    It can automatically download prebuilt Qt binaries for any target (you're
    not bound to Linux binaries on Linux; you could also download iOS binaries).

    *[openHAB Add-ons](https://github.com/denisacostaq/openhab-addons)* is the
    official set of add-ons that are implemented on top of openHAB Core APIs.

    *[arduino-cmake](https://github.com/denisacostaq/arduino-cmake/tree/develop)*
    The Arduino CMake build system integrates tightly with the Arduino SDK. So
    if you like to do things from the command line (using make), or to build
    you're firmware where you're in control, or if you would like to use an IDE
    such as Eclipse, KDevelop, XCode, CodeBlocks or something similar, then
    Arduino CMake is the system for you.

    *[hardware-wallet](https://github.com/skycoin/hardware-wallet/commits?author=stdevAlDen)*
    is a physical hardware wallet for signing skycoin transactions and messages,
    it have a client library ([hardware-wallet-go](https://github.com/skycoin/hardware-wallet-go/commits?author=stdevAlDen))
    for device comunication making use of protocol buffer ([hardware-wallet-protob](https://github.com/skycoin/hardware-wallet-protob/commits?author=stdevAlDen))
    messages. Adiatianally there is a tool ([Random Number Generator (RNG) tests](https://github.com/denisacostaq/rng-test/commits/feature/update_after_libopencm3_changes))
    for validating the cryptographyc API.
