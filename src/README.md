Extra Experience
----------------

Personal projects
:   *[DAQs (Data Acquisition System)](https://github.com/denisacostaq/DAQs)* is
    a basic proff of concept project for avaluating the posibility to create
    portable (Desktop + Android) applications by using Qt technologies. From
    this project you can learn how to use some cool stuff like, travis CI
    pipelines, croscompiling C++/Qt projects to Android/ARM based mobiles,
    github badges, code coverage report, documentation generation using Doxygen
    and so on.

    *[Todo list](https://github.com/denisacostaq/todolist-go)* is a basic demo
    to demostrate how to use the golang
    [revel](https://revel.github.io/manual/index.html) framework for creating a
    RESTFull full-stack web application using AngularJS for the frontend and gorm
    as ORM library.

    *[clang-format-binary-releases](https://github.com/denisacostaq/clang-format-binary-releases)*
    is a ready to use binary executable for GNU/Linux and MacOS operatin systems
    of the [Clang Format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) project.

    * These items can also contain lists, but you need to mind the
      indentation levels in the markdown source.
    * Second item.

    *[stm3210fx3](https://github.com/denisacostaq/firmware-stm3210fx3)* an
    autotools based template to work with stm3210fx3 microcontrollers using the
    STM32F10x_StdPeriph and Free-RTOS libraries.

    *[SavingLasVegas](https://github.com/denisacostaq/SavingLasVegas)* a
    C++/cocos2d-x based video game for mobile devices (Android).


Open Source
:   *[Embedded IDE](http://martinribelotta.github.io/embedded-ide)* project on
    github, this IDE, is mainly used for programming the
    [CIAA platform](http://www.proyecto-ciaa.com.ar/index_quees_en.html).

    * Makefile based, C/C++ IDE
    * Makefile based, C/C++ IDE
    * [aa](https://github.com/martinribelotta/embedded-ide/)

    *[Qt CLI installer](https://github.com/denisacostaq/qli-installer)* is a
    simple script replacing the official online-only graphical Qt installer.
    It can automatically download prebuilt Qt binaries for any target (you're
    not bound to Linux binaries on Linux; you could also download iOS binaries).

    official set of add-ons that are implemented on top of openHAB Core APIs.

    *[arduino-cmake](https://github.com/denisacostaq/arduino-cmake/tree/develop)*
    The Arduino CMake build system integrates tightly with the Arduino SDK. So
    if you like to do things from the command line (using make), or to build
    you're firmware where you're in control, or if you would like to use an IDE
    such as Eclipse, KDevelop, XCode, CodeBlocks or something similar, then
    Arduino CMake is the system for you.

    *[hardware-wallet](https://github.com/skycoin/hardware-wallet/commits?author=stdevAlDen)*
    is a physical hardware wallet for signing skycoin transactions and messages,
    it have a client library ([hardware-wallet-go](https://github.com/skycoin/hardware-wallet-go/commits?author=stdevAlDen))
    for device comunication making use of protocol buffer ([hardware-wallet-protob](https://github.com/skycoin/hardware-wallet-protob/commits?author=stdevAlDen))
    messages. Adiatianally there is a tool ([Random Number Generator (RNG) tests](https://github.com/denisacostaq/rng-test/commits/feature/update_after_libopencm3_changes))
    for validating the cryptographyc API.


Programming Languages
:   **first-lang:** Here, we have an itemization, where we only want
    to add descriptions to the first few items, but still want to
    mention some others together at the end. A format that works well
    here is a description list where the first few items have their
    first word emphasized, and the last item contains the final few
    emphasized terms. Notice the reasonably nice page break in the pdf
    version, which wouldn't happen if we generated the pdf via html.

:   **second-lang:** Description of your experience with second-lang,
    perhaps again including a [link] [ref], this time placing the url
    reference elsewhere in the document to reduce clutter (see source
    file). 

:   **obscure-but-impressive-lang:** We both know this one's pushing
    it.

:   Basic knowledge of **C**, **x86 assembly**, **forth**, **Common Lisp**
